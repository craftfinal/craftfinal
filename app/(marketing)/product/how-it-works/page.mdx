# How it Works

CraftFinal is a cutting-edge web application designed to revolutionize the way individuals and organizations develop their most crucial documents: **pitch documents.**

## The core of the problem is human nature...

Mastering the art of pitching requires embracing iteration, a challenging yet vital process for those striving to reach new heights of success. The reluctance to iterate, often coupled with the fear of failure, can hinder progress. CraftFinal transforms this iterative process into an engaging and rewarding experience.

## How CraftFinal helps

Here's how CraftFinal streamlines and enhances document creation:

1. **Template Adaptation**: Users start by selecting a template. They can easily modify it to fit their needs, whether for a resume, cover letter, or a response to a specific Request for Proposals (RFP). While resumes and cover letters benefit from past versions and the job description, consultancy documents require more nuanced tailoring. In both scenarios, CraftFinal enables efficient content reuse and customization.

2. **Pre-population with Prior Documents**: CraftFinal allows users to import relevant previous documents. Our advanced language model amalgamates the collective wisdom from these documents, generating an initial draft of the new document.

3. **Iterative Enhancement with CraftFinal**: The true magic of CraftFinal lies in its iterative improvement process. Here's what sets it apart:

### Key Advantages

#### 1. Complete Historical View

Users can view the current document version alongside a comprehensive history of alternatives for any selected section, providing unparalleled context and choice.

#### 2. Measurable Improvement

CraftFinal provides real-time feedback on the current document's score. It also predicts how potential changes, like modifying certain bullet points, might impact this score, guiding users towards the most impactful revisions.

#### 3. Targeted Suggestions from Generative AI

CraftFinal offers tailored suggestions that consider both the specific requirements of the job or RFP and the user's previous interactions. This personalized approach ensures that each iteration is informed by past decisions, allowing CraftFinal to provide increasingly refined and effective recommendations.

CraftFinal doesn't just help create documents; it learns and evolves with each version crafted, ensuring that every iteration brings you closer to your goal.
