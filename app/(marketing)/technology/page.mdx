Craft Final addresses this category of problems, as follows.

First, the user uses a template and adapts it to the final version of their document. This is straightforward in the case of a resume or cover letter given both past versions of these documents and the job description. It is significantly more involved for a consultancy that answers to a specific Request for Proposals (RFP) of a potential client. But also in the latter case, a lot of content can be re-used and tailored automatically.

Second, the user pre-populates the template by ingesting all relevant prior documents. Craft Final uses a large language model to combine the collected wisdom from all these documents to prepare an initial version of the completed template.

Third, CraftFinal provides a score to the contents of the current version and makes suggestions, which parts to focus on when improving. It is this third step where CraftFinal really sets itself apart, based on three key aspects of how the user proceeds.

1. The user sees at once both the current version of the document as well as is able to browse all alternatives for the highlighted section of the document
2. The user obtains in real-time the current score for their version as well as an indication, how to score would change if they exchanged some bullet points
3. The user is provided with alternative proposals that take into account both the target needs, i.e., the job description or RFP from the prospective client, as well as all previous interactions of the user.

This way, CraftFinal learns continuously from the decisions taken by the user and is able to make better and better suggestions.
