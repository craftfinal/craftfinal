I am building a web application that helps individuals and organizationt to collaborate and iterate on the core of the documents that make or break their business. Let me give you a few examples.

## Consulting

Consulting: Consulting companies strive to standardize their services into products, such as maturity assessments or risk assessments but also IT architecture and data governance operating models. Nonetheless, they pitch these services to each prospective client very individually, using the wording and attitude of the client to appears as wholly committed to serve just this specific client to address their specific problem within the client's circumstances.

When preparing these pitch decks, concultants typically start with a so-called "dot-dash" storyline, i.e., a bulleted list with two levels. The first level, the "dot", is the heading of the slide they ultimately aim to create (or re-use), the second level, the "dashes", then describe the content of the slide.

As you can imagine, established office tools such as PowerPoint and Word are used for these purposes. But what they lack is an overview of all "dot" and "dash" level bullets that have previoiusly been used. This leads to the consultants diving through reams of files from previous pitches and stitching together what they find. Often, they can't find what they thought they had already created in the past and create it again, thereby incurring additional work and potentially introducing unnecessary errors that need to be corrected down the road.

## Job applications

A similar challenge arises when people apply for jobs, where each resume and particularly their cover letter needs to be tailored to the specific job description - when in fact the person always has the same skills and is just re-packaging her skills and attitudes in a way that the potential employer might like best.

Also in the situation of the job seeker, the process of applying is tedious and error-prone.
