Try my **CraftFinal** _now_.

CraftFinal is a web application that helps individuals and organizations to collaborate and iterate on the core of the documents that make or break their business. Let me give you a few examples.

Consulting: Consulting companies strive to standardize their services into products, such as maturity assessments or risk assessments but also IT architecture and data governance operating models. Nonetheless, they pitch these services to each prospective client very individually, using the wording and attitude of the client to appears as wholly committed to serve just this specific client to address their specific problem within the client's circumstances.

When preparing these pitch decks, concultants typically start with a so-called "dot-dash" storyline, i.e., a bulleted list with two levels. The first level, the "dot", is the heading of the slide they ultimately aim to create (or re-use), the second level, the "dashes", then describe the content of the slide.

As you can imagine, established office tools such as PowerPoint and Word are used for these purposes. But what they lack is an overview of all "dot" and "dash" level bullets that have previoiusly been used. This leads to the consultants diving through reams of files from previous pitches and stitching together what they find. Often, they can't find what they thought they had already created in the past and create it again, thereby incurring additional work and potentially introducing unnecessary errors that need to be corrected down the road.

A similar challenge arises when people apply for jobs, where each resume and particularly their cover letter needs to be tailored to the specific job description - when in fact the person always has the same skills and is just re-packaging her skills and attitudes in a way that the potential employer might like best.

Also in the situation of the job seeker, the process of applying is tedious and error-prone.

Craft Final addresses this category of problems, as follows.

First, the user uses a template and adapts it to the final version of their document. This is straightforward in the case of a resume or cover letter given both past versions of these documents and the job description. It is significantly more involved for a consultancy that answers to a specific Request for Proposals (RFP) of a potential client. But also in the latter case, a lot of content can be re-used and tailored automatically.

Second, the user pre-populates the template by ingesting all relevant prior documents. Craft Final uses a large language model to combine the collected wisdom from all these documents to prepare an initial version of the completed template.

Third, CraftFinal provides a score to the contents of the current version and makes suggestions, which parts to focus on when improving. It is this third step where CraftFinal really sets itself apart, based on three key aspects of how the user proceeds.

1. The user sees at once both the current version of the document as well as is able to browse all alternatives for the highlighted section of the document
2. The user obtains in real-time the current score for their version as well as an indication, how to score would change if they exchanged some bullet points
3. The user is provided with alternative proposals that take into account both the target needs, i.e., the job description or RFP from the prospective client, as well as all previous interactions of the user.

This way, CraftFinal learns continuously from the decisions taken by the user and is able to make better and better suggestions.
