 * - `New`: The item has been created on the client and has not yet been acknowledged by the server.
 * - `Modified`: The item is known to the server but has been modified on the client.
 * - `Synced`: The item is in sync between the client and the server, with no pending changes.
 * - `Deleted`: The item has been marked for deletion on the client and awaits confirmation from the server.

 * specific client-server interaction. It is maintained by each client but not
 * by the server. The server utilizes this enum when responding to a client,
 * thus the meanings of `New`, `Modified`, `Synced`, and `Deleted` always
 * refer to the state last known or acknowledged by the client.
